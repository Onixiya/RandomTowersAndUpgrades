# Random Towers And Upgrades

BTD6 Mod that can randomize towers in a few ways and can also randomizes upgrades. <a href="https://github.com/gurrenm3/BTD-Mod-Helper">Requires Mod helper</a>

Was based off from gurrenm4's old random towers mod but it doesn't really resemble it at all now

# 

Random Tower on Place

Randomizes a tower you place down

Random Upgrades

Changes the upgraded tower to a random one

Randomize in Round

Randomizes all towers placed down, can control how often it happens with Random Timer

Random Timer

Timer in seconds how often towers should be randomized with Randomize in Round

Allow Recursion

By default, certain towers are blacklisted from being chosen for a random tower but this can be ignored 
completely if this is enabled.
You will probs crash the game pretty quickly if this is enabled so be careful with this option

Random Key

Allows you to randomize all towers by pressing a certain key. Must be a valid Unity Keycode Number. 
Refer to the unitykeycodes.txt file in the repo for a full list of the available ones you can set it to. 
Default is 305 which corresponds to Right Control so if you want to change it to space bar for example, 
change this to 32
